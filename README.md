# Chat App Demo

This is Chat app demo based on the Youtube video [Let's build SIGNAL with REACT NATIVE](https://youtu.be/MJzmZ9qmdaE). Two major changes are 1) bug fixes and 2) May 2022 versions of React Native and Expo tools. The development has three phases:

- Login and Register
- Home Screen and Sign out
- Chat and Messages

## 1 Login and Register

### 1.1 Initialization

Run `expo init my-chat -t blank` to intialize a project named as `my-chat`. Change the name if you like a different one.
